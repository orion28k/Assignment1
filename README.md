#In-class Assignment

Create a C# solution with two projects, a class library and a test project. The class library should contain
a method that checks the strength of a password. There are four criteria: having atleast one captial letter,
one lowercase letter, one number, and one symbol. If no criteria are met, the password is ”INELIGABLE”,
if one is met, the password is ”WEAK”, if two or three criteria are met, the password is ”MEDIUM”, and if
all the criteria are met, ”STRONG”. Your test project should test 100% of the method. The solution should
be submitted as a GitHub link and contain a .gitignore file blocking all /obj and /bin folders.
